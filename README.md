# AI for Everyone — learn, build, and question AI

**An open learning guide in English and German.** Explore 36 matched chapters, from machine learning and language models to RAG, agents, security, evaluation, and production engineering. Every chapter includes a worked example, a failure mode, an exercise with an answer, and links to primary reading.

## Canonical files on main

The unified Codex guide is the primary edition on `main`. Read and update these sources:

| Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [English guide](docs/en/README.md) | All 36 English chapters and reference pages in `docs/en/` |
| [German guide](docs/de/README.md) | All 36 matching German chapters and reference pages in `docs/de/` |
| [Chapter manifest](data/chapters.json) | Shared chapter order, topics, and prerequisites |
| [Website architecture](WEBSITE.md) | Build and deployment of the site generated from these sources |

Earlier V1.2 indexes and chapter addresses are compatibility links to this edition. Make content changes in the canonical language directories and keep both editions synchronized; see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Language architecture](docs/language-map.md).

The website works as a static GitHub Pages site. It has no account, analytics service, external font dependency, or runtime API. Reading progress and bookmarks stay in the current browser. All chapters and navigation remain readable when JavaScript is disabled; search, interactive tools, and saved progress require JavaScript.

## Edition 2.1

A refreshed interface adds larger type, responsive navigation, a personal next-chapter panel, and a focused reading view (shortcut `F`). Export your progress as a JSON backup and import it on another browser: valid backups merge completed chapters and bookmarks without removing existing entries. Files are processed locally. German and English share the same progress.


## Find your starting point

- **Understand AI:** chapters 1–6 cover models, learning, Transformers, language models, generative AI, and RAG.
- **Build agents:** chapters 7–9, 14–15, 17, 24, 27, and 29–30 connect tools, context, permissions, runtime design, and tests.
- **Operate systems:** chapters 19–23, 25–26, 31–32, and 34–36 address observability, data, serving, recovery, evaluation, privacy, and costs.

The other chapters deepen architectures and research boundaries. AGI and ASI are capability and hypothetical future concepts; they are not guaranteed engineering milestones.

## Run the website locally

Node.js 22+ and npm are required for the build. Python 3.10+ is required only for the optional examples.

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`. The `dist/` folder contains the complete deployable site; no Node.js process is needed on GitHub Pages. After editing a chapter, run `npm run build` again. Browser tests can be run with `npx playwright install chromium && npm run test:e2e` where browser downloads are available.

See [WEBSITE.md](WEBSITE.md) for the file layout and deployment, [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for editing guidelines, and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for completed work and open opportunities. Previous V1.2 entry points and chapter URLs remain as pointers to the current editions.

### Edition 2.2: clearer learning navigation

Learning paths show individual progress, finished chapters have a visible state, and completing the guide points to practice projects. A collapsible chapter outline is available on phones and tablets; desktop outlines highlight the current section. Deployment checks now verify the actual public German and English pages after publication.
